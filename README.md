# Playground Portfolio - Static Minified React Portfolio using Styled Componenets
This was an attempt to use React with Styled Components. As Styled Componenets is not as readable and no longer the new kid on the block. I will not be continuing with Styled components. The site is still deployed using git hub pages and can be viewed here [https://flintsable.github.io/Portfolio/](https://flintsable.github.io/Portfolio/)
